###### Iris Data Set Project Outline And Objectives
<p align ="justify"> The following project is based on the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. In this project I will use this data set for researching and explaining what it it about and write some Python scripts to backup and explain my findings. The main objectives are as follows</p>

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it. 
1. Keep a list of references I used in completing the project. 
1. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it. 
1. Summarise the data set.
1. Write a summary of my investigations. 
1. Include supporting tables and graphics.

    The Iris Data Set is one of the best known and commonly used datasets that is used by anyone and especially those who wants to develop the skills as they start their journey in the area of Data Science. According to (Kaggle.com, 2019) "The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species". <br><br> This dataset is a record containing measurements and consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris that include the Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. These measurements include the petal lengths & width and the sepal lengths & width. The dataset is often used to demonstrate simple machine learning techniques and became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning.(Archive.ics.uci.edu, 2019)
